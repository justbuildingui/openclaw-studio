State directory resolution is inconsistent: config lookup in src/lib/clawdbot/config.ts searches both ~/.moltbot and ~/.clawdbot, but agent workspace paths in src/lib/projects/agentWorkspace.ts and agent state paths in src/app/api/projects/[projectId]/tiles/route.ts and src/app/api/projects/[projectId]/tiles/[tileId]/route.ts are hard-coded to ~/.clawdbot. This can split state across directories depending on environment variables, which makes onboarding and cleanup confusing.

Extract a single state-dir resolver (for example in src/lib/clawdbot/stateDir.ts) that applies the same env and fallback rules as loadClawdbotConfig, then update all filesystem paths that rely on ~/.clawdbot to use it. Touch src/lib/projects/agentWorkspace.ts, src/app/api/projects/[projectId]/tiles/route.ts, src/app/api/projects/[projectId]/tiles/[tileId]/route.ts, and any other locations that build agent paths from CLAWDBOT_STATE_DIR; add a small unit test to lock down path resolution ordering.

Acceptance criteria: all agent workspace and state paths resolve from the same function and honor MOLTBOT_STATE_DIR/CLAWDBOT_STATE_DIR consistently; documentation reflects the single source of truth; and tests cover env override precedence. Open question: should MOLTBOT_STATE_DIR always win over CLAWDBOT_STATE_DIR, or do we need a migration path for existing users.
