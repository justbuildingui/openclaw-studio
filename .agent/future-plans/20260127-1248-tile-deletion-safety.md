Deleting a tile triggers server-side directory removal in src/app/api/projects/[projectId]/tiles/[tileId]/route.ts via fs.rmSync, but the UI delete button in src/features/canvas/components/AgentTile.tsx does not confirm or summarize what will be removed. This is a high-risk action because it can delete both the agent workspace and agent state directories without any reversible path.

Add a confirmation flow that shows the exact directories slated for deletion and require a typed confirmation for tiles with existing workspaces; consider adding a server-side archive mode that moves directories to a trash location under the state dir instead of deleting outright. Update the delete endpoint to support a mode flag (archive vs delete), return the resolved paths in its response, and update the client to opt into archive by default with an explicit "permanently delete" option.

Acceptance criteria: tile deletion cannot proceed without an explicit confirmation, the API returns the paths that were archived/deleted, and the UI exposes a reversible archive workflow. Open question: should archives auto-expire or require a manual cleanup command, and where should that live in the UI.
